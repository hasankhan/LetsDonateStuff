Its a website where you can find things that you need (instead of buying new ones) or if you have something extra lying around the house that your friend, neighbor, family or anyone else can make good use of then you can post it.

This website is an effort to start a new culture in which we save the environment by not throwing away old stuff, prevent land fill, re-use things from others instead of buying new ones and share our stuff with people who need them.
